Merchant is solely responsible\n            for maintaining the Third-Party Services and obtaining any associated licenses and\n            consents necessary for Merchant to use the Third-Party Services in connection with the\n            Services.</p>\n          <p>(d) Tabs Innovation IP and Reservation of Rights. All right, title, and interest in and\n            to (i) the Platform and Services, (ii) the Aggregate Data, (iii) all modifications,\n            improvements, adaptations, enhancements, or translations made to any of the foregoing,\n            and (iv) Tabs Innovation IP and all proprietary rights therein, will be and remain the\n            sole and exclusive property of Tabs Innovation and our licensors. Merchant agrees that\n            the only rights it has with respect to the Platform are the limited access and use\n            rights expressly granted in this Agreement. No rights are granted to Merchant hereunder\n            (whether by implication, estoppel, exhaustion or otherwise) other than as expressly set\n            forth in this Agreement.</p>\n          <p>(e) Feedback. From time-to-time Merchant or its employees, contractors, or\n            representatives may provide Tabs Innovation with suggestions, comments, feedback or the\n            like with regard to the Services (collectively, “Feedback”). Merchant hereby grants Tabs\n            Innovation a worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable,\n            transferable, sublicensable, exclusive license to use and exploit all Feedback in\n            connection with Tabs Innovation’s business purposes, including, without limitation, the\n            testing, development, maintenance and improvement of the Services.</p>\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          <strong>PAYMENT PROCESSING AND PROCESSING FEES</strong>\n          <p>Tabs Innovation uses a third-party payment processor (the “Processor”) to process all\n            payments made through the Platform. The terms and conditions of the Processor,\n            [https://stripe.com/ssa][the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the\n            Stripe Services Agreement], are incorporated into this Agreement by reference and by\n            agreeing to the terms of this Agreement, you are also agreement to such the terms and\n            conditions of such Processor agreements. As a condition of Tabs Innovation enabling\n            payment processing services through Processor, Merchant agrees to provide Tabs\n            Innovation accurate and complete information about Merchant’s representative and its\n            business, and Merchant authorizes Tabs Innovation to share such information and all\n            transaction information related to Merchant’s use of the payment processing services\n            provided by Processor. Upon account creation, Merchant shall be solely responsible for\n            the accuracy and integrity of the information associated with their Processor\n            account(s). Tabs Innovation will not be responsible for making additional payments to\n            Merchants due to missing or inaccurate information. Processor has been audited by a\n            PCI-certified auditor and is certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1. Merchant hereby\n            also agrees that Tabs Innovations shall be permitted to charge payment processing fees\n            to Merchant and deduct any such fees due from payments owed to Merchant. At the time of\n            this Agreement such payment processing fee shall be 2.90% of any payments processed\n            through the Platform plus a $0.30 charge per payment transaction/swipe, less a $0.30\n            credit per Service Fee charged to Customers of Merchant. Such fee and credit amounts and\n            rates may be changed or otherwise modified by Tabs Innovation on three (3) business days\n            notice to Merchant, which notice may be by electronic mail.</p>\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          <strong>ADDITIONAL MERCHANT OBLIGATIONS.</strong>\n          <p>Merchant Obligations Generally. Merchant: (a) hereby authorizes Tabs Innovation to\n            request identity-verifying information about Merchant including a consumer report that\n            contains Merchant’s name and address and authorizes Tabs Innovation to periodically\n            obtain additional reports; and b) shall provide additional information as Tabs\n            Innovation may reasonably request, which information shall be true and correct, for the\n            purposes of meeting onboarding, periodic review requirements, Tabs Innovation’s internal\n            audit, as well as government or regulatory entity requests.</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <strong>ADDITIONAL TABS INNOVATION OBLIGATIONS</strong>\n          <p>Tabs Innovation shall comply with all applicable domestic and international laws and\n            regulations pertaining to data privacy, personal data, trans-border data flow and data\n            protection (including, without limitation, the requirements of HIPAA and its\n            implementing regulations) and the PCI Data Security Standards (the “Data Protection\n            Requirements”), as applicable, and will implement, keep current and adhere to a set of\n            practices and procedures sufficient to enable such compliance (“Data Protection\n            Requirements”).</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <strong>NON-EXCLUSIVITY.</strong>\n          <p>Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Tabs Innovation from offering its\n            services to any third party or using such services or the Tabs Innovation IP in the\n            ordinary course of its business.</p>\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          <strong>FEES AND PAYMENT, TAXES.</strong>\n          <ol>\n            <li>Fees. Tabs Innovation will not charge Merchant any fees at this time, but reserves\n              the right to change its policies and collect from Merchant, in consideration for the\n              Services, non-refundable fees (“Fees”) or applicable charges and to institute new\n              charges and Fees at the end of the initial Subscription Term or any renewal thereof,\n              upon thirty (30) calendar days’ prior notice to Merchant (which may be sent by email).\n              However, Tabs Innovation will charge all users of the Platform a service fee (a\n              “Service Fee”), which will be added to all orders processed through the Platform and\n              shall be deducted from any payments made through the Processor prior to Tabs\n              Innovation transferring any such funds to Merchant. At the time of this Agreement such\n              Service Fee shall be $0.49 per Customer transaction placed through the Platform. Such\n              Service Fee may be changed or otherwise modified by Tabs Innovation on three (3)\n              business days notice to Merchant, which notice may be by electronic mail.\n            </li>\n            <li>Payments. Tabs Innovation will pay for orders processed through the Platform by\n              Merchant each week on a consistent day of the week, subject to change with no less\n              than seven (7) calendar days’ notice to Merchants by email or service notification.\n              Tabs Innovation shall be entitled to deduct from such payments Customer Service Fees,\n              payment processing fees, Equipment related fees and set-offs, and any other fees which\n              Tabs Innovation may notify you regarding with at least seven (7) calendar days’\n              advance written notice. Merchant agrees Tabs Innovation may charge the Customer fees,\n              including but not limited to a Service Fee where applicable in Tabs Innovation’s sole\n              discretion. In the event that Merchant raises the price for a menu item, Tabs\n              Innovation shall not be required to remit the higher price to the Merchant until three\n              (3) business days after the Merchant first provides notice to Tabs Innovation of such\n              pricing change.\n            </li>\n            <li>Taxes. Merchant is responsible for all sales, use, ad valorem and excise taxes, and\n              any other similar taxes, duties and charges of any kind imposed by any federal, state,\n              multinational or local governmental regulatory authority on the sale of Merchant\n              products and on any amount payable by Merchant to Tabs Innovation hereunder, other\n              than any taxes imposed on Tabs Innovation’s income, and Merchant shall additionally be\n              responsible for remitting such sales, use, ad valorem and excise taxes, and any other\n              similar taxes, duties and charges to the appropriate authorities. Without limiting the\n              foregoing, in the event that Merchant is required to deduct or withhold any taxes from\n              the amounts payable to Tabs Innovation hereunder, Merchant will pay an additional\n              amount, so that Tabs Innovation receives the amounts due to it hereunder in full, as\n              if there were no withholding or deduction.\n            </li>\n            <li>Third-Party Fees. To the extent that a third party provider provides services to\n              Merchant via the Platform (for example, a middleware provider) and charges fees to\n              Tabs Innovation, Tabs Innovation may pass through such third party’s fees to Merchant.\n            </li>\n            <li>Required Tax Collection. In some jurisdictions in the United States, Tabs Innovation\n              may be required to collect sales, use, or similar taxes from the Customer and remit\n              such taxes directly to the tax authority. In such jurisdictions, Tabs Innovation will\n              inform Merchant that Tabs Innovation will remit any collected taxes to the tax\n              authority and Tabs Innovation will be relieved of any responsibility to remit such\n              collected taxes to Merchant.\n            </li>\n            <li>Merchant Review of Charges. Merchant agrees, on an ongoing basis, to review and\n              confirm its transactions, fees and charges on orders and invoices, and to promptly\n              communicate to Tabs Innovation in writing any claimed inaccuracies, so that Tabs\n              Innovation has the prompt opportunity to address and resolve any issues and so such\n              issues do not persist, which both Tabs Innovation and Merchant agree is in the best\n              interests of both parties and their commercial relationship. Merchant agrees to\n              communicate to Tabs Innovation any disagreement, non-conformity or any issue with any\n              transaction, fee, charge or order, including in connection with fraudulent\n              transactions or payments, within fourteen (14) calendar days of payment to Merchant\n              for the transaction, fee or order in question. Merchant shall be deemed to have\n              acquiesced in and ratified, and to have waived any claim or objection regarding, each\n              transaction, fee, charge and order if Merchant does not communicate a written claim or\n              objection to Tabs Innovation regarding such transaction, fee, charge or order within\n              such 14-day period.\n            </li>\n            <li>Merchant Title to Goods. Merchant agrees that Merchant holds title to the goods or\n              products that Merchant provides through the Platform until the goods are delivered by\n              Merchant to Customer, and that title passes from the Merchant to the Customer upon\n              delivery at the Merchant’s location. Merchant agrees that Tabs Innovation does not\n              hold title to or acquires any ownership interest in any goods or products that\n              Merchant prepares or provides through the Platform.\n            </li>\n          </ol>\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          <strong>EQUIPMENT</strong>\n          <p> With respect to the Platform, Merchant will install any equipment reasonably required\n            by Tabs Innovation to access the Platform Services (“Equipment”). Any Equipment provided\n            by Tabs Innovation will remain Tabs Innovation’s sole property and may be used solely\n            for purposes related to fulfilling Merchant’s responsibilities under this Agreement.\n            Merchant will inspect all hardware, and shall notify Tabs Innovation in writing if any\n            Equipment is missing or was damaged as soon as practicable after discovering such\n            damage. Tabs Innovation may restrict or rescind Merchant’s right to use the Platform at\n            any time by giving notice. Merchant will be responsible for any damage to or loss of any\n            Equipment provided by Tabs Innovation (excluding ordinary wear and tear), which will be\n            promptly reimbursed by Merchant (at the replacement cost thereof). Tabs Innovation may\n            recover the replacement cost of damaged or lost Equipment by deducting such amount from\n            any payments to Merchant. Merchant agrees to pay all subscription fees and deposits\n            reasonably charged by Tabs Innovation for Equipment, and agrees Tabs Innovation may\n            deduct such fees and deposits from amounts payable by Tabs Innovation to Merchant.\n            Merchant shall return all Equipment provided by Tabs Innovation to Tabs Innovation\n            within the Return Period. Merchant hereby authorizes Tabs Innovation to put a $250\n            pre-authorization hold on a credit card provided by Merchant to Tabs Innovation and, in\n            the event Merchant has not returned the Equipment to Tabs Innovation on or before the\n            expiration of the Return Period, Merchant further authorizes Tabs Innovation to charge\n            such $250 amount to such Merchant credit card to offset amounts due to Tabs Innovation\n            in respect of such unreturned Equipment. Tabs Innovation shall be permitted to pursue\n            any and all recourse available to it to recover such Equipment and amounts required to\n            replace such Equipment, including, without limitation, in the event such $250 payment\n            does not cover the full replacement cost of such unreturned Equipment.

The Party seeking defense and indemnity (the\n            “Indemnified Party”) will promptly (and in any event no later than thirty (30) days\n            after becoming aware of facts or circumstances that could reasonably give rise to any\n            Claim) notify the other Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) of the Claim for which\n            indemnity is being sought, and will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in\n            the defense and/or settlement thereof. The Indemnifying Party will have the sole right\n            to conduct the defense of any Claim for which the Indemnifying Party is responsible\n            hereunder (provided; however, that the Indemnifying Party may not settle any Claim\n            without the Indemnified Party’s prior written approval unless the settlement is for a\n            monetary amount, unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party from all liability\n            without prejudice, does not require any admission by the Indemnified Party, and does not\n            place restrictions upon the Indemnified Party’s business, products or services). The\n            Indemnified Party may participate in the defense or settlement of any such Claim at its\n            own expense and with its own choice of counsel or, if the Indemnifying Party refuses to\n            fulfill its obligation of defense, the Indemnified Party may defend itself and seek\n            reimbursement from the Indemnifying Party.</p>\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          <strong>WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</strong>\n\n          <ol>\n            <li>\n              WARRANTY DISCLAIMER: THE PLATFORM, THE SERVICES, THE MATERIALS, AND ALL OTHER CONTENT\n              ON THE PLATFORM ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY\n              KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING HEREIN.

All goodwill and improved reputation\n            generated by Tabs Innovation’s use of the Merchant Marks inures to the exclusive benefit\n            of Merchant. Tabs Innovation will use the Merchant Marks in the form stipulated by\n            Merchant and will conform to and observe such standards as Merchant prescribes from time\n            to time in connection with the license granted hereunder (“Marketing Guidelines”). Tabs\n            Innovation may in its sole discretion and subject to any Marketing Guidelines by\n            Merchant at the execution of this Agreement, issue marketing material, press releases or\n            other publicity regarding this Agreement or the contents hereof.</p>\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          <strong>MARKETING.</strong>\n          <p>Merchant agrees that Tabs Innovation may include Merchant’s name and logo in Tabs\n            Innovation’ published Merchant list.\n          </p>\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          <strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong>\n          <p>PLEASE READ THIS “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION CAREFULLY. IT LIMITS THE WAYS YOU CAN\n            SEEK RELIEF FROM TABS INNOVATION AND REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES ON AN INDIVIDUAL\n            BASIS.</p>\n\n          <p>I. Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure.</p>\n          <p>There might be instances when a dispute arises between you and Tabs Innovation. In\n            those instances, Tabs Innovation is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable\n            resolution; however, we can only do this if we know about and understand each other’s\n            concerns. Therefore, for any issue or dispute that arises between you and Tabs\n            Innovation, both parties acknowledge and agree that they will first make a good faith\n            effort to resolve it informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution\n            proceeding in arbitration or otherwise. This includes first sending a written\n            description of the dispute to the other party. For any dispute you initiate, you agree\n            to send the written description of the dispute along with the email address associated\n            with your account to the following email address: legal@tabs.nyc. For any dispute that\n            Tabs Innovation initiates, we will send our written description of the dispute to the\n            email address associated with your account. The written description must be on an\n            individual basis and provide at least the following information: your name; the nature\n            or basis of the claim or dispute; and the relief sought.</p>\n          <p>You and Tabs Innovation then agree to negotiate in good faith about the dispute through\n            an informal telephonic dispute resolution conference between you and Tabs Innovation.\n            The informal telephonic dispute resolution conferences shall be individualized such that\n            a separate conference must be held each time either party intends to commence individual\n            arbitration; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same\n            informal telephonic dispute resolution conference. If either party is represented by\n            counsel, that party's counsel may participate in the informal telephonic dispute\n            resolution conference, but the party also must appear at and participate in the\n            conference. This should lead to resolution, but if for some reason the dispute is not\n            resolved satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description\n            of the dispute, you and Tabs Innovation agree to the further dispute resolution\n            provisions below.</p>\n          <p>This informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to\n            commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding. The you agree that any relevant\n            limitations period and filing fee or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties\n            engage in this informal dispute resolution process.</p>\n          <p>II. Mutual Arbitration Agreement. You and Tabs Innovation agree that all claims,\n            disputes, or disagreements that may arise out of the interpretation or performance of\n            this Agreement or payments by or to Tabs Innovation, or that in any way relate to your\n            use of the Platform, the Materials, the Services, and/or other content on the Platform,\n            your relationship with Tabs Innovation, or any other dispute with Tabs Innovation, shall\n            be submitted exclusively to binding arbitration. This includes claims that arose, were\n            asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior Agreement\n            as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p>\n          <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, issues related to the scope, validity, and\n            enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate are for a court to decide. Also, each\n            party retains the right to (1) elect to have any claims heard in small claims court on\n            an individual basis for disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s\n            jurisdiction and (2) seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent\n            jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or\n            violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other\n            confidential or proprietary information or intellectual property rights.</p>\n          <p>ARBITRATION MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY WILL DECIDE THE CLAIM.\n            RIGHTS TO PREHEARING EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND APPEALS MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.\n            YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND TABS INNOVATION ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT\n            TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>\n          <p>III. Class Action and Collective Relief Waiver.</p>\n          <p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, EXCEPT AS SET OUT\n            IN SECTION VII BELOW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE\n            ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, JOINT, COLLECTIVE OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR IN A PURPORTED\n            REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS CLAIMS AS A PRIVATE\n            ATTORNEY GENERAL OR FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF). UNLESS BOTH YOU AND TABS INNOVATION\n            OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S\n            CLAIMS (EXCEPT AS SET OUT IN SECTION VII BELOW), AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY\n            FORM OF ANY CLASS, JOINT, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY\n            AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING ANY DECLARATORY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE\n            INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN\n            INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD RELIEF FOR OR AGAINST ANYONE WHO\n            IS NOT A PARTY TO THE PROCEEDING.</p>\n          <p>This Class Action and Collective Relief Waiver is an essential part of this “Dispute\n            Resolution” section, and if it is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a\n            particular claim or dispute, neither you nor Tabs Innovation is entitled to arbitration\n            of such claim or dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a court determines that the\n            Class Action and Collective Relief Waiver is not enforceable as to a particular claim or\n            request for relief and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted (or the\n            decision is otherwise final), then the parties agree that that particular claim or\n            request for relief may proceed in court but shall be severed and stayed pending\n            arbitration of the remaining claims.</p>\n          <p>IV. Arbitration Rules.</p>\n          <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).\n            If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration\n            provider. Except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” provision, the AAA will\n            administer the arbitration in accordance with either (A) the Commercial Arbitration\n            Rules then in effect, or (B) the Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect if the matter\n            involves a “consumer” agreement as defined by Consumer Arbitration Rule R-1 (together,\n            the “Applicable AAA Rules”). The Applicable AAA Rules are available at\n            https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</p>\n          <p>V. Arbitration Process.</p>\n          <p>If after sixty (60) days the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure above is\n            unsuccessful in resolving the parties’ dispute, a party who desires to initiate\n            arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as\n            specified in the Applicable AAA Rules. (The AAA provides applicable forms for Demands\n            for Arbitration available at\n            https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand_for_Arbitration_0.pdf (Commercial\n            Arbitration Rules) and\n            https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Demand_for_Arbitration_Form_1.pdf\n            (Consumer Arbitration Rules), and a separate affidavit for waiver of fees for California\n            residents only is available at\n            https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Waiver_of_Fees_CA_Only.pdf.) The arbitrator will be\n            either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state or county in\n            which you reside. The parties will first attempt to agree on an arbitrator. If the\n            parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within twenty-one (21) days of receiving\n            the AAA’s list of eligible neutrals, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in\n            accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>\n          <p>VI. Arbitration Location and Procedure.</p>\n          <p>Unless you and Tabs Innovation otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in\n            the county where you reside. If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and\n            you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted\n            solely on the basis of documents you and Tabs Innovation submit to the arbitrator,\n            unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If the amount in\n            controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, your right to a\n            hearing will be determined by the Applicable AAA Rules. Subject to the Applicable AAA\n            Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of\n            information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.\n            Unless otherwise prohibited by law, all arbitration proceedings will be confidential and\n            closed to the public and any parties other than you and Tabs Innovation, and all records\n            relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court\n            confirmation of the arbitration award.</p>\n          <p>VII. Batch Arbitration.</p>\n          <p>To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the\n            event 100 or more similar arbitration demands presented by or with the assistance or\n            coordination of the same law firm or organization are submitted to AAA or another\n            arbitration provider (if AAA is unavailable) against Tabs Innovation within a 30-day\n            period (or in otherwise close proximity), the arbitration provider shall (i) administer\n            the arbitration demands in batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are\n            fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final\n            batch will consist of the remaining demands); (ii) designate one arbitrator for each\n            batch; and (iii) provide for a single filing fee due per side per batch. You agree to\n            cooperate in good faith with Tabs Innovation and the arbitration provider to implement\n            such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution\n            of claims, including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of\n            claims. This “Batch Arbitrations” provision shall in no way be interpreted as\n            authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Tabs Innovation does not agree or consent to\n            class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint\n            or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this section\n            VII.</p>\n          <p>VIII. Arbitrator's Decision.</p>\n          <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable\n            AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions\n            upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be\n            entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will have the authority\n            to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis,\n            any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available\n            under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement. The arbitrator's\n            award of damages and/or other relief must be consistent with section III above and also\n            must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to\n            the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held\n            liable.</p>\n          <p>Attorneys’ fees will be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration only if\n            authorized under applicable substantive law governing the claims in the arbitration. If\n            the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in\n            your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as\n            measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), Tabs\n            Innovation will have the right to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses.</p>\n          <p>IX. Fees.</p>\n          <p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative, and/or arbitrator fees will\n            be solely as set forth in the applicable AAA Rules (as modified by section VII above).\n            If, however, you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be\n            prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, Tabs Innovation will pay as\n            much of the filing, administration, and/or arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems\n            necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive to you.</p>\n          <p>X. Right to Opt-Out of Arbitration.</p>\n          <p>Tabs Innovation’s updates to these Terms and Conditions do not provide you with a new\n            opportunity to opt out of this Mutual Arbitration Agreement if you previously agreed to\n            an Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. Tabs Innovation will continue\n            to honor any valid opt outs if you opted out of this Mutual Arbitration Agreement in a\n            prior version of the Terms and Conditions. To opt out of the Mutual Arbitration\n            Agreement, you must notify Tabs Innovation in writing no later than 30 days after first\n            becoming subject to this Mutual Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your\n            name and address, the email address you currently use to access your Tabs Innovation\n            account (if you have one), and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Mutual\n            Arbitration Agreement.

This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written\n              document executed by duly authorized representatives of the Parties.\n            </li>\n            <li>Notices. All notices required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing,\n              will reference this Agreement, and will be sent to the relevant address set forth\n              below or to such other address as may be specified by the relevant Party to the other\n              Party in accordance with this Section 0 (b). Such notices will be deemed given: (i)\n              when delivered personally; (ii) one (1) business day after deposit with a nationally\n              recognized express courier, with written confirmation of receipt; (iii) three (3)\n              business days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt\n              requested, postage prepaid; or (iv) when sent by email, on the date the email was sent\n              without a bounce back message if sent during normal business hours of the receiving\n              party, and on the next business day if sent after normal business hours of the\n              receiving party.\n\n              <p>If to Tabs Innovation:</p>\n              <code>\n                Tabs Innovation\n                500 7th Avenue, 8th Floor\n                New York, NY 10018\n                Attention: Lucas Kooyman\n                Email: legal@tabs.nyc\n              </code>\n              <p>If to Merchant:</p>\n              <code>\n                To the address provided in the Merchant Application Form.\n              </code>\n            </li>\n\n            <li>Waiver. Either Party’s failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not\n              constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. No waiver of\n              any provision of this Agreement will be effective unless it is in writing and signed\n              by the Party granting the waiver.\n            </li>\n            <li>Severability. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (see “Dispute\n              Resolution”, Section III), if any portion of this Agreement is found to be void,\n              invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable\n              and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that matches the intent\n              of the original provision as closely as possible. The remainder of this Agreement\n              shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein.\n            </li>\n            <li>Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in\n              accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any\n              principles of conflict of laws that would lead to the application of the laws of any\n              other jurisdiction. Any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement will\n              be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in New York County, New\n              York and the Parties irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts\n              and hereby irrevocably waive any objection to the laying of venue in such courts. The\n              Parties expressly agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\n              International Sale of Goods shall not apply.\n            </li>\n            <li>Assignment. Neither Party may assign or transfer this Agreement, without the other\n              Party’s prior written consent; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing,\n              either Party may assign or transfer this Agreement (i) to any of its Affiliates or\n              (ii) to a third party that succeeds to all or substantially all of the assigning\n              Party’s business and assets relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, whether\n              by asset sale, merger, operation of law or otherwise. Subject to the foregoing, this\n              Agreement is binding upon and will inure to the benefit of each of the Parties and\n              their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any attempt to assign or transfer\n              this Agreement in violation of this Section will be void.\n            </li>\n            <li>Equitable Relief. Each Party agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such Party\n              of any of its obligations under Section 6 or, in the case of Merchant, Section 2(b),\n              would cause the other Party irreparable harm and significant damages for which there\n              may be no adequate remedy under law and that, in the event of such breach or\n              threatened breach, the other Party will have the right to seek immediate equitable\n              relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any\n              other relief that may be available from any court. Such remedies are not exclusive and\n              are in addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity or\n              otherwise.\n            </li>\n            <li>Force Majeure. Neither Party will be responsible for any failure or delay in the\n              performance of its obligations under this Agreement (except for any payment\n              obligations) due to causes beyond its reasonable control, which may include, without\n              limitation, labor disputes, strikes, lockouts, shortages of or inability to obtain\n              energy, raw materials or supplies, denial of service or other malicious attacks,\n              telecommunications failure or degradation, pandemics, epidemics, public health\n              emergencies, governmental orders and acts (including government-imposed travel\n              restrictions and quarantines), material changes in law, war, terrorism, riot, or acts\n              of God.\n            </li>\n            <li>Payment Set Aside. Upon written notice, specifying in reasonable detail the basis\n              therefor, Tabs Innovation may set-off any amounts due or payable by Merchant to Tabs\n              Innovation under this Agreement or any other agreement between the Parties against\n              amounts otherwise due or payable by Tabs Innovation to Merchant under this Agreement.\n              The exercise of such right of set-off by Tabs Innovation in good faith, whether or not\n              ultimately determined to be justified, will not constitute breach of the terms of this\n              Agreement.\n            </li>\n            <li>Subcontracting. Tabs Innovation may use subcontractors, and other third-party\n              providers (“Subcontractors”) in connection with the performance of its own obligations\n              hereunder as it deems appropriate; provided that Tabs Innovation remains responsible\n              for the performance of each such Subcontractor. Notwithstanding anything to the\n              contrary in this Agreement, with respect to any third-party vendors including any\n              hosting (e.g., AWS) or payment vendors (e.g., credit card processors and point of\n              service payment system providers), Tabs Innovation will use commercially reasonable\n              efforts to guard against any damages or issues arising in connection with such\n              vendors, but will not be liable for the acts or omissions of such third-party vendors\n              except to the extent that it has been finally adjudicated that such damages or issues\n              are caused directly from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Tabs\n              Innovation.\n            </li>\n            <li>Export Regulation. The Platform (including, without limitation, any Mobile\n              Application) may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries or those persons\n              or entities prohibited from receiving exports from the United States. In addition, the\n              Platform may be subject to the import and export laws of other countries. Merchant\n              agrees to comply with all United States and foreign laws related to use of the Mobile\n              Applications and the Platform.\n            </li>\n            <li>U.S. Government End Users. If the Platform (including, without limitation, any\n              Mobile Application) is being acquired or accessed on behalf of the United States\n              Government, then the following provision applies: The Platform will be deemed to be\n              “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,”\n              respectively, pursuant to DFAR § 227.7202 and FAR § 12.212, as applicable. Any use,\n              reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the Platform and any\n              accompanying documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by this\n              Agreement and is prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by this\n              Agreement.\n            </li>\n            <li>Relationship of the Parties. The relationship between the Parties is that of\n              independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to establish any\n              partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between the Parties, and neither\n              Party will have the power or authority to bind the other or incur any obligations on\n              the other’s behalf without the other Party’s prior written consent.\n            </li>\n            <li>No Third-Party Beneficiaries. No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer\n              any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations, or liabilities hereunder upon any third\n              party other than the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.\n            </li>\n            <li>Affiliates. Parties’ affiliates and the Indemnified Parties shall be third party\n              beneficiaries for all purposes under this Agreement including any Merchant Application\n              Form. All claims by the affiliates shall be made and brought by the Parties on behalf\n              of the affiliates unless otherwise required by law.\n            </li>\n            <li>Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which is\n              deemed an original, but all of which together are deemed to be one and the same\n              agreement.\n            </li>\n            <li>Captions and Headings. The captions and headings used in this Agreement are used for\n              convenience only and are not to be given any legal effect.\n            </li>\n\n          </ol>\n        </li>\n\n      </ol>\n\n      <p>\n        <strong>APPENDIX A - DEFINITIONS</strong>\n      <p>“Affiliate” means, with respect to any entity, any other entity that, directly or\n        indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under\n        common control with, such entity.
